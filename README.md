# Spring WebFlux

Spring WebFlux is parallel version of Spring MVC and supports fully non-blocking reactive streams. It support the back pressure concept and uses Netty as inbuilt server to run reactive applications. If you are familiar with Spring MVC programming style, you can easily work on webflux also.
